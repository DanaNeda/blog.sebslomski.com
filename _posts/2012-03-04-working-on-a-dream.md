> "When I was very young and the urge to be someplace else was on me, I was assured by mature people that maturity would this itch. When years described me as mature, the remedy prescribed was middle age.In middle age I was assured greater age would calm my fever and now that I am fifty-eight perhaps senility will do the job. Nothing has worked. Four hoarse blasts of a ships's whistle still raise the hair on my neck and set my feet to tapping. The sound of a jet, an engine warming up, even the clopping of shod hooves on pavement brings on the ancient shudder, the dry mouth and vacant eye, the hot palms and the churn of stomach high up under the rib cage. In other words, once a bum always a bum. I fear this disease incurable. I set this matter down not to instruct others but to inform myself....A journey is a person in itself; no two are alike. And all plans, safeguards, policing, and coercion are fruitless. We find after years of struggle that we not take a trip; a trip takes us."
*- John Steinbeck, Travels With Charley: In Search of America*


Hi, I'm Sebastian. I'm a software engineer, based in Munich, Germany. Originally I'm from a village close to Deggendorf, Lower Bavaria. And I'm going to move to London in May.


## Why ##
More then two and a half year ago, I decided to move to Munich after finishing my apprenticeship. The official reason was because of the job (back then I was quite into Python, which I still am; and Python jobs are rare in Germany).
But I guess the real reason was to explore new things and, like Steinbeck said, *to be someplace else*.
Moving to Munich was one of the best things I've ever done. I met awesome people, learned a lot from them and finally got *my shit together* (kind of).
I grew up.

Nowadays, I love Munich. It's a great place to live. The city is beautiful and the alps are close (I love hiking and skiing). But apparently it is hard for me to find the right job. Munich appears quite conservative and reserved to new technology (but it's getting better). Most of the web developer jobs here are at agencies who do websites for their clients.

But I would like to create kick ass web apps with cutting edge technology. And I also love to talk english, which I train at the local meet ups and during my travels.

And that's why I am going to move to London.

London offers great jobs for enthusiastic web engineers, has plenty of startups and is in Europe, which makes all the bureaucratic stuff easier for me as an european citizen.

When talking with my best friend about this, she still can't understand how I can leave my family, my friends and everything I built up here.
If you put a bunch of fish in a tank, most of them would be happy about don't having to be in fear about being eaten by a bigger fish or to get food on a regular basis.
But one of these fish would swim unhappy in the tank and would always think about being in the big ocean.  I think I am this fish.


## What this blog is going to be about ##
I'm doing a lot of research about moving to London these days and I would love to offer this information to other people who are thinking about doing the same.
I also hope to get feedback and tips from people who did something similar.


So, stay tuned!
