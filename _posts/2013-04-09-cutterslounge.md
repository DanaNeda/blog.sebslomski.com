# Real artists ship

Half a year ago I quit my job, changed country and started to work on my dream running my own business together with a good friend.

Today, we ship.

I've worked for quite a few companies on quite interesting projects and we built really cool stuff. But even compared to them, [Cutters Lounge](http://cutterslounge.de) is more than amazing. It's the best web app I've ever built or worked on.

Summarized, Cutters Lounge is a web app for hair dressers helping them to organise their daily routine and to boost their revenue by sending appointment invitations to customers.

There is an old Chinese quote:
> "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single app."
*- (~Lao-tzu, Chinese philosopher (604 BC - 531 BC))*


Note: Please read this really slow and accentuated in the voice of either Steve Jobs or Morgan Freeman
